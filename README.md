# ZSFW-DVR
An Enhanced Zeroth-Order Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Framework for Constrained Finite-Sum Optimization

ðŸ“š Overview

ZSFW-DVR is an advanced implementation of the Zeroth-Order Stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithm tailored for constrained finite-sum optimization problems. This framework is particularly effective in scenarios where gradient information is unavailable or expensive to compute, making it suitable for tasks such as black-box optimization and adversarial machine learning.
